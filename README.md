Ionised sodium has spectral lines denoted as D1 and D2, the close magnitude of respective wavelengths requires high precision instruments to calculate the difference in wavelength between the spectral lines. This experiment uses a calibrated Michelson interferometer and interference properties of light to achieve this precision. The separation of D1 and D2 lines were calculated by varying the path lengths of one of the sodium light beams and taking successive measurements for the positions of the mirror that corresponded to each interference pattern. From the experiment, the difference in wavelength between sodium D1 and D2 lines were calculated to be (5.83±0.04) ×10-10 m.
